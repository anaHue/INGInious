Groups & Audiences
==================

Those two structure lets teacher manage the course easily by defining his needs. By default a course doesn't contain no audience and no group. Depending on the needs, it will be recommend to use audience or group. But both can be used together as well.

Audiences
---------
Based on a description, an audience is a subset of students. This subset have no specific size. A list of tutors can be set to see the audience.

It's an administrative way to represent users. It lets the teacher manage users in his own structure.
Thanks to that, the teacher can analyze a target public. Pay attention that audiences are not useful for group submissions.

Groups
------
Groups are also subset of students based on a description. Those lets students submit together for a task. it so avoid multiple submission for a work group.
Those groups are size limited an may be restricted to some audiences.
